# SmartMemory Licensing Guide

## Overview

SmartMemory uses a **dual licensing model** to support both open-source innovation and commercial sustainability. This guide explains when you need which license and how to obtain them.

## License Types

### ðŸ†“ AGPL v3 (Open Source)
- **Cost**: Free
- **Best for**: Open-source projects, research, internal tools
- **Requirements**: Your application must be open-sourced under AGPL v3
- **Source code**: Must be disclosed if you distribute or provide as a service

### ðŸ’¼ Commercial License
- **Cost**: Paid (contact for pricing)
- **Best for**: Proprietary applications, commercial products, SaaS
- **Requirements**: None beyond license agreement
- **Source code**: No disclosure required

## When Do I Need a Commercial License?

### âœ… AGPL v3 is sufficient for:
- **Open-source projects** that are published under AGPL-compatible licenses
- **Academic research** and educational use
- **Internal company tools** that are not distributed externally
- **Personal projects** and experimentation
- **Public sector** and government applications (if open-sourced)

### ðŸ’° Commercial license required for:
- **Commercial SaaS products** that use SmartMemory
- **Proprietary software** that incorporates SmartMemory
- **White-label solutions** or products resold to customers
- **Closed-source applications** distributed to end users
- **Enterprise applications** where source code cannot be disclosed
- **Mobile apps** published to app stores (unless open-sourced)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use SmartMemory in my startup's product?
**A:** If your product is proprietary or closed-source, you'll need a commercial license. If you're willing to open-source your entire application under AGPL v3, you can use the free version.

### Q: What if I'm just testing or prototyping?
**A:** Testing and internal prototyping is generally fine under AGPL v3. Once you deploy to production or distribute to users, license requirements apply.

### Q: Can I modify SmartMemory's code?
**A:** Yes, under both licenses. AGPL v3 requires you to share your modifications if you distribute. Commercial license has no such requirement.

### Q: What about using SmartMemory in a larger application?
**A:** AGPL v3 is "viral" - if you incorporate SmartMemory into a larger application, the entire application must be open-sourced under AGPL v3. Commercial license removes this requirement.

### Q: Can I offer services based on SmartMemory?
**A:** 
- **Consulting/integration services**: Generally okay under AGPL v3
- **Hosted SaaS offering**: Requires commercial license
- **Managed SmartMemory service**: Requires commercial license

### Q: What about government or non-profit use?
**A:** Non-profits and government agencies can use AGPL v3 if they're willing to open-source their applications. Many prefer commercial licenses for operational flexibility.
