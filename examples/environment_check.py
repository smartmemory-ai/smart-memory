"""
Environment check for SmartMemory.

Performs non-destructive checks:
- Loads MemoryConfig and prints resolved path/namespace
- Instantiates SmartMemory
- Runs a tiny graph search
- Instantiates VectorStore and performs a small search
- Attempts cache access (read-only)

All checks are best-effort and print clear diagnostics.
